## Relational Algebra and SQL Fundamental
* A database is a collection of persisted data to write to and read from later
* Types: Relational Stores, Graph Databases, Document Databases, Column Stores, Key-Value Stores
* Codd's Relational Model
1. A relation (tables) is a set of tuples (rows)
2. Each element (cell value) in a tuple is a member of a data domain (set of allowed value)
3. These elements are called attribute values (cell value), and are associated with an attribute (column name + type)
* Schema: shape of your data
* Relational Algebra: (imperative) step by step process to gewt result
* Relational Calculus: (declarative) just cares about end result
* Codds Thereom: there is a relational calculus way for a relational algebra way and vice versa
* SQL is a Relational Calculus way, inspired by Codd's realtionbal Model
* Query, Statement, Select Clause, Where Clause -> predicate -> expression

## Basic SELECT
* SELECT returns a result set, where result is a row
* FROM allows one or more elements to be returne```d from a relation
